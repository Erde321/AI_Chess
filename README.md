# AI_Chess

## Description
AI_Chess is a personal project aimed at practicing Python while developing an AI system capable of learning and improving at chess. The goal is to train different AI models to play chess and analyze their performance over time.

## Rules

I will try my best to not use AI for simple programming.

## Features
- Implementation of various AI techniques for chess playing
- Training and evaluation of different AI models
- Experimentation with reinforcement learning and neural networks

## Requirements
To run AI_Chess, you need the following dependencies:

```bash
will follow
```

## Usage
Run the main script to start training an AI model:

```bash
will follow
```

## Roadmap
- Implement basic rule-based AI
- Train AI using reinforcement learning
- Develop an interface for AI vs. AI matches
- Optimize model performance

## Contributions
This is a personal learning project, but contributions and suggestions are welcome!
